My name is Taylor Rhodes. I am 18 years old and I am currently dating the love of my life Stormi. I love football; my favorite teams are the Oregon Ducks and the Denver Broncos. I also am a fan of baseball. My favorite team is the Colorado Rockies. I recently graduated High School and now trying out for an internship in Software Engineering. I worked at an amazing company called High Country Harley-Davidson in Frederick,CO. I currently live in Colorado, but I will need to move to Arizona for the internship. That's a little about me.
